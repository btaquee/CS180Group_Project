## Introduction

Many Americans face numerous financial challenges under certain circumstances, particularly during the pandemic. A large group of cardholders can’t pay their credit card bill in one, resulting in them paying high interest fees. On the other hand, many cardholders may or may not be able to pay their bill in one, but those who use only a single or a very few number of cards miss out on potential rewards that would have been earned by using more suitable cards for specific categories, such as groceries, gas, and dining. Our web app addresses both problems separately and together: a budget tracker to reduce interest costs, and a card-rewards optimizer to help users earn more on ordinary spending.

## Installation/Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- Git

### First Time Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/btaquee/CardSense.git
cd CardSense
```

#### 2. Backend Setup (Django)
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install Django dependencies
pip install django djangorestframework django-cors-headers

# Run database migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup (React)
Open a **NEW** terminal window and run:
```bash
# Navigate to web folder
cd web

# Install React dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Application

You need **TWO terminal windows** running simultaneously:

#### Terminal 1 - Django Backend
```bash
# Navigate to project root (CardSense folder)
cd CardSense

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate

# Start Django server
python manage.py runserver
```
✅ Backend runs at: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**

#### Terminal 2 - React Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to web folder
cd CardSense/web

# Start React dev server
npm start
```
✅ Frontend runs at: **http://localhost:3000/**

### Testing the Setup

1. **Backend Health Check**: Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/accounts/health/
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`

2. **Frontend**: Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Should display the React application

### Stopping the Servers
Press `CTRL+C` in each terminal window to stop the servers.

### Important Notes
⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Make sure you run commands from the correct directory:
- Django commands: Run from `CardSense/` (project root)
- React commands: Run from `CardSense/web/` (web folder)

⚠️ **Virtual Environment**: Always activate the virtual environment before running Django commands.
