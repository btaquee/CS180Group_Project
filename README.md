## Introduction

Many Americans face numerous financial challenges under certain circumstances, particularly during the pandemic. A large group of cardholders canâ€™t pay their credit card bill in one, resulting in them paying high interest fees. On the other hand, many cardholders may or may not be able to pay their bill in one, but those who use only a single or a very few number of cards miss out on potential rewards that would have been earned by using more suitable cards for specific categories, such as groceries, gas, and dining. Our web app addresses both problems separately and together: a budget tracker to reduce interest costs, and a card-rewards optimizer to help users earn more on ordinary spending.
